Hi {{first_name}},

We made a commitment: once we hit $1M, we would open 100 sponsored spots for people ready to build income in insurance without paying upfront to get started.

That opportunity is now open.

What this includes:
- No upfront cost to start through sponsorship
- Support for licensed agents who want to build production fast
- Step-by-step support for unlicensed agents to get licensed and launch

If this is something you want to be considered for, reply with:
"I'm ready for sponsorship."

We'll send the next steps and see if you qualify for one of the remaining spots.

Respectfully,
The Legacy Link Team
